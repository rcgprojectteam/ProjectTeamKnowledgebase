**Pre-replacement Assessment:**
**Current System Review:** Begin with a comprehensive examination of the existing BRaV(c) system. This includes understanding its current configurations, backup schedules, and any specialized settings or integrations that are active.
**Data Backup:** Ensure that all critical data on the BRaV(c) is backed up to an external source or cloud storage to prevent any potential data loss during the transition.

**Procurement and Pre-setup:**
**BRaV(d) Acquisition:** Acquire the BRaV(d) device. Ensure the device is delivered with all necessary components, including cables, power adapters, and documentation.
**Initial Configuration:** Prior to physical installation, access the device interface to initiate the basic configuration steps, such as setting up the device name, IP addresses, and other basic network settings.

**Physical Installation:**
**Uninstallation of BRaV(c):** Carefully disconnect and remove the BRaV(c) device from its current setup. Note the connections and any special configurations for reference.
**Installing BRaV(d):** Position the BRaV(d) in the desired location, ensuring it's in a well-ventilated area to avoid overheating. Connect the necessary cables, including power and network cables.

**System Configuration:**
**Backup Settings:** Configure the backup schedules, retention policies, and other essential settings on the BRaV(d), using the BRaV(c)'s settings as a reference when necessary.
**Test Backup:** Run a test backup to ensure that the BRaV(d) is correctly capturing data and that there are no issues with the backup process.

**Data Migration:**
**Data Transfer:** Migrate all relevant data from the BRaV(c)'s backup or the external source to the BRaV(d). Ensure that the data is correctly structured and accessible.
**Data Integrity Verification:** Once the data has been transferred, run a verification process to ensure that all data is intact and no corruption occurred during the migration.

**Final Steps:**
**Monitoring and Alert Setup:** Configure the monitoring and alerting features on the BRaV(d) to be alerted to any potential issues or failures.
**Documentation:** Document the new setup, configurations, and any changes made during the process for future reference.
