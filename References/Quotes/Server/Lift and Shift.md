**Pre-Migration Assessment:**
**Infrastructure Inventory:**
**Server Details:** Catalogue all server specifications, including hardware, operating system, software applications, and network configurations.
**Dependency Mapping:**
**Interconnected Systems:** Identify systems that interact with the server, understanding data flows and integration points.
**Application Dependencies:** Discover software dependencies, ensuring all requisite libraries, frameworks, and supporting software are noted.

**Migration Planning:**
**Risk Assessment:** Identify potential migration risks and devise strategies to mitigate them.
**Scheduling:**
**Migration Window:** Determine an optimal time frame for migration that minimizes business disruption.
**Stakeholder Notification:** Inform relevant stakeholders of the upcoming migration and any expected impacts.

**Environment Preparation:**
**Destination Setup:**
**Network Configuration:** Set up network configurations, including IP addressing, firewall rules, and VPN tunnels if required.

**Execution of Lift and Shift:**
**Data Transfer:**
**Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously observe the migration progress, ensuring data is being transferred efficiently and securely.
Configuration Replication:
**System Settings:** Replicate server-specific settings, including user permissions, scheduled tasks, and environment variables in the destination.
**Application Setup:** Ensure applications on the server run correctly post-migration by configuring them as per their dependencies.

**Validation and Testing:**
**Functionality Tests:**
**Applications:** Verify that all applications are running as expected in the new environment.
**Data Integrity:** Confirm that no data was lost or corrupted during the migration.
**Performance Monitoring:**
**Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and storage performance to ensure they are in line with expectations.
**Network Performance:** Check network throughput, latency, and other metrics to ensure optimal connectivity.

**Post-Migration Activities:**
**Decommissioning:**
**Server Shutdown:** Once all data is confirmed to be safely migrated and operational, shut down the source server to prevent any data divergence.
**Asset Management:** Update asset management records to reflect the server's decommissioned status.
**Documentation:**
**Migration Report:** Document the migration process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned.
**Environment Details:** Update environment documentation to include details of the new setup and configurations.

**Stakeholder Communication:**
**Completion Notification:**
**Migration Status:** Inform all relevant stakeholders about the successful completion of the migration.
**Access Details:** Provide information on how to access and interact with the server in its new location.
**Feedback Collection:**
**User Experience:** Gather feedback from end-users regarding their experiences post-migration to identify any unseen issues or areas of improvement.
**Continuous Improvement:** Use the collected feedback to make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
