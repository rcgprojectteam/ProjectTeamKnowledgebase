Migration Execution: Implement the migration strategy developed during the discovery phase. This will involve using migration tools to move data in batches or all at once, based on the planned approach.

User Permissions Setup: Configure user permissions and access rights on Microsoft Teams according to predefined roles and responsibilities.

Data Validation: Post-migration data validation to ensure completeness and accuracy. Any discrepancies or errors will be logged and resolved.

Integration and Testing: Integrate migrated data with existing systems and workflows within Microsoft Teams. Conduct thorough testing to ensure seamless functionality and data accessibility.
